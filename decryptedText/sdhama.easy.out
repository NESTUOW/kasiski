I DREAMED ALL NIGHT ABOUT INDIANS, DESERTS, AND SILVER BARS, AND IN DUE
TIME, NEXT DAY, WE TOOK SHIPPING AT THE ST. LOUIS WHARF ON BOARD A
STEAMBOAT BOUND UP THE MISSOURI RIVER.

WE WERE SIX DAYS GOING FROM ST. LOUIS TO "ST. JO."--A TRIP THAT WAS SO
DULL, AND SLEEPY, AND EVENTLESS THAT IT HAS LEFT NO MORE IMPRESSION ON MY
MEMORY THAN IF ITS DURATION HAD BEEN SIX MINUTES INSTEAD OF THAT MANY
DAYS.  NO RECORD IS LEFT IN MY MIND, NOW, CONCERNING IT, BUT A CONFUSED
JUMBLE OF SAVAGE-LOOKING SNAGS, WHICH WE DELIBERATELY WALKED OVER WITH
ONE WHEEL OR THE OTHER; AND OF REEFS WHICH WE BUTTED AND BUTTED, AND THEN
RETIRED FROM AND CLIMBED OVER IN SOME SOFTER PLACE; AND OF SAND-BARS
WHICH WE ROOSTED ON OCCASIONALLY, AND RESTED, AND THEN GOT OUT OUR
CRUTCHES AND SPARRED OVER.

IN FACT, THE BOAT MIGHT ALMOST AS WELL HAVE GONE TO ST. JO. BY LAND, FOR
SHE WAS WALKING MOST OF THE TIME, ANYHOW--CLIMBING OVER REEFS AND
CLAMBERING OVER SNAGS PATIENTLY AND LABORIOUSLY ALL DAY LONG.  THE
CAPTAIN SAID SHE WAS A "BULLY" BOAT, AND ALL SHE WANTED WAS MORE "SHEAR"
AND A BIGGER WHEEL.  I THOUGHT SHE WANTED A PAIR OF STILTS, BUT I HAD THE
DEEP SAGACITY NOT TO SAY SO.




CHAPTER II.

THE FIRST THING WE DID ON THAT GLAD EVENING THAT LANDED US AT ST. JOSEPH
WAS TO HUNT UP THE STAGE-OFFICE, AND PAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
APIECE FOR TICKETS PER OVERLAND COACH TO CARSON CITY, NEVADA.

THE NEXT MORNING, BRIGHT AND EARLY, WE TOOK A HASTY BREAKFAST, AND
HURRIED TO THE STARTING-PLACE.  THEN AN INCONVENIENCE PRESENTED ITSELF
WHICH WE HAD NOT PROPERLY APPRECIATED BEFORE, NAMELY, THAT ONE CANNOT
MAKE A HEAVY TRAVELING TRUNK STAND FOR TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS OF BAGGAGE
--BECAUSE IT WEIGHS A GOOD DEAL MORE.  BUT THAT WAS ALL WE COULD TAKE
--TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS EACH.  SO WE HAD TO SNATCH OUR TRUNKS OPEN, AND MAKE A
SELECTION IN A GOOD DEAL OF A HURRY.  WE PUT OUR LAWFUL TWENTY-FIVE
POUNDS APIECE ALL IN ONE VALISE, AND SHIPPED THE TRUNKS BACK TO ST. LOUIS
AGAIN.  IT WAS A SAD PARTING, FOR NOW WE HAD NO SWALLOW-TAIL COATS AND
WHITE KID GLOVES TO WEAR AT PAWNEE RECEPTIONS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS, AND
NO STOVE-PIPE HATS NOR PATENT-LEATHER BOOTS, NOR ANYTHING ELSE NECESSARY
TO MAKE LIFE CALM AND PEACEFUL.  WE WERE REDUCED TO A WAR-FOOTING.  EACH
OF US PUT ON A ROUGH, HEAVY SUIT OF CLOTHING, WOOLEN ARMY SHIRT AND
"STOGY" BOOTS INCLUDED; AND INTO THE VALISE WE CROWDED A FEW WHITE
SHIRTS, SOME UNDER-CLOTHING AND SUCH THINGS.  MY BROTHER, THE SECRETARY,
TOOK ALONG ABOUT FOUR POUNDS OF UNITED STATES STATUTES AND SIX POUNDS OF
UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY; FOR WE DID NOT KNOW--POOR INNOCENTS--THAT SUCH
